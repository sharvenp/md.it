A dead-simple desktop markdown editor developed using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

The editor live previews the markdown in side-by-side view, and offers the basic functions of any text editor such as opening files, saving files, and saving files as a new file.

In addition, the editor supports a simple set of commands:

- "Modfier + b" to **bold**
- "Modifier + e" to _italicize/emphasize_
- "Modfiier + k" to create `in-line code block`
- "Modifier + Shift + d" to ~~strikethrough~~ 

("Modifier" is the modifier key in your platform - for example this is the "Ctrl" key in Windows)
